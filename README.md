# CMPSC 448 - Homework 4
## Chase Rensberger - chr5119

To whoever is grading this: this assignment has a lot of files so I made this README to explain where everything is. 

- Problem 1 is located in Problem1.pdf
- Problem 2 is contained in the Jupyter Notebook called Problem2.ipynb (This notebook also references/uses 3 other python files called Problem2BoostedDecisionTrees.py; Problem2RandomForests.py; Problem2SVMwGK.py)
- Problem 3 is located in Problem3.py and relevant plots for problem 3 are located in Problem3Plots.pdf with comments inside of the python file to explain what is going on
